1.In the first question I showed the transformation of a electric field under a lorentz and galilean transformation. I have initially chosen a consistent value of the electric and magnetic value.

2. In the second code I have given foe only one beta value but we can change the beta value in the code to get the plots for the three beta values mentioned in the question.

3. In the third question I have plotted the lifetime of the particle as seen from the lab frame. I have assumed a initian lifetime value in the frame of the particle.
